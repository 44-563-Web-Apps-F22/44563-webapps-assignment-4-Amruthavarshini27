        <P song="song">Through the night, the constellations,<br>
            Have given light from various stations.<br>
            When midnight gloom falls on all nations,<br>
            We will resume our occupations.<br></P>

        <p class="song">Our light, it's true, is not worth mention;<br>
           What can we do to gain attention.<br>
           When night and noon with vulgar glaring<br>
           A great big moon is always flaring.<br></p>
        <p class="direction">[During chorus, enter Diana, an elderly goddess. She is carefully
            wrapped up in cloaks, shawls, etc.  A hood is over her head, a
            respirator in her mouth, and galoshes on her feet. During the
            chorus, she takes these things off and discovers herself dressed
            in the usual costume of the Lunar Diana, the goddess of the moon.]</p>

        <p class="speech">[shuddering] Ugh. How cold the nights are.  I don't know how
          it is, but I seem to feel the night air a good deal more than I
          used to. But it is time for the sun to be rising. [Calls] Apollo.</p>

        <P class="direction">[Enter Apollo. He is an elderly "buck" with an air of assumed
            juvenility and is dressed in dressing gown and smoking cap.]</P>
        <h4 class="Ap">AP.</h4>
        <P class="speech">[yawning] I shan't go out today. I was out yesterday and the
        day before and I want a little rest. I don't know how it is,but I
        seem to feel my work a great deal more than I used to.</P>
        <H4 class="DIA">DIA.</H4>
        <P class="speech">I am sure these short days can't hurt you.  Why you don't
        rise til six and you're in bed again by five; you should have a
        turn at my work and see how you like that—out all night.</P>
        <h4 class="Ap">AP</h4>
        <p class="speech">My dear sister, I don't envy you—though I remember when I
        did—but that was when I was a younger sun.  I don't think I'm
        quite well.  Perhaps a little change of air will do me good. I've
        a mind to show myself in London this winter. They'll be very glad
        to see me. No. I shan't go out today. I shall send them this
        fine, thick wholesome fog and they won't miss me.  It's the best
        substitute for a blazing sun—and like most substitutes, nothing
        at all like the real thing.</p>
