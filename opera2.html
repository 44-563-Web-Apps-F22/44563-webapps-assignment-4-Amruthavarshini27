        <P class="speech">[yawning] I shan't go out today. I was out yesterday and the
        day before and I want a little rest. I don't know how it is,but I
        seem to feel my work a great deal more than I used to.</P>

        <P class="speech">I am sure these short days can't hurt you.  Why you don't
        rise til six and you're in bed again by five; you should have a
        turn at my work and see how you like that—out all night.</P>

        <p class="speech">My dear sister, I don't envy you—though I remember when I
        did—but that was when I was a younger sun.  I don't think I'm
        quite well.  Perhaps a little change of air will do me good. I've
        a mind to show myself in London this winter. They'll be very glad
        to see me. No. I shan't go out today. I shall send them this
        fine, thick wholesome fog and they won't miss me.  It's the best
        substitute for a blazing sun—and like most substitutes, nothing
        at all like the real thing.</p>

        <P class="speech">Home at last. A nice time I've had of it.</P>

        <P class="speech">You young scamp you've been out all night again. This is the
        third time you've been out this week.</P>
